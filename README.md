This game is a work in progress.

You require an emulator to play the game. From your emulator open the file with the extension ".nes"

This was made entirely using 6502 assembly with the NESASM3 assembler.

This game is inspired by the stardew valley minigame, Journey of the Prairie King.

Controls:

  Directions go without saying.
  
  A to shoot
  
  B to stand still (for aiming)
  
  Start is used for pausing and resetting the game

Future additions:

I would like to add music to the game.

I would like to add enemies to the game that can fly over barriers.

I would like to include powerups.
